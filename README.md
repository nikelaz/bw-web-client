## Contributing

At this stage pull requests/contributions will not be accepted, as the project is being developed as part of a YouTube series and there is a strict plan by which the initial development will be done. If you wish to suggest changes during this stage you can leave a comment in one of the YouTube videos.

After the YouTube series is finished the repository will be open for contributions and I will update the guidelines.
